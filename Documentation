Abstract 

Sentiment Analysis is a branch of Natural Language Processing which intends to identify the sentiment in the data being analyzed through polarity analysis and emotion analysis.
This study explored sentiment analysis techniques using Python, focusing on Naive Bayes and logistic regression classifiers trained on labeled datasets.
Both classifiers effectively predicted sentiment polarity, with logistic regression showing slightly better accuracy and F1-score. 
We analyzed preprocessing techniques and feature selection methods to enhance classification accuracy. 
Applying these techniques to real-world social media data revealed valuable insights into user sentiment trends, beneficial for businesses. 
Overall, the study underscores the effectiveness of Naive Bayes and logistic regression in sentiment analysis, emphasizing the importance of preprocessing and feature selection for model performance.

Sentiment Distribution(figure 3)
This line graph presents the sentiment distribution generated by ChatGPT. 
Sentiments are grouped into "bad," "good," and "neutral," with corresponding counts. 
"Bad" sentiment is most common, occurring 107,796 times, followed by "good" with 56,011, and "neutral" with 55,487. 
This breakdown provides insights into the prevalence of different sentiments within the ChatGPT-generated data


Distribution of Tweets(figure 4)
The bar graph visualizes the frequency distribution of the top seven most common words extracted from ChatGPT tweets.
Each bar corresponds to a word, and its height indicates the frequency of occurrence in the dataset. 
Different colors are used to distinguish between the bars, offering a visual depiction of the word frequencies.


Model Comparison:
Naive Bayes:
high precision (96%) and recall (90%) for Class 0, indicating accurate classification and effective identification of instances. 
Balanced F1-score (0.93) for Class 0 demonstrates a robust balance between precision and recall, ensuring reliable classification.
Overall accuracy of 91% signifies satisfactory performance in correctly classifying instances across both classes.

Logistics Regression:
Class 0 shows exceptional precision (0.97) and recall (0.98), indicating accurate classification and strong identification of instances.
With an F1-score of 0.97 for class 0, the model achieves a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, ensuring reliable classification.
The overall accuracy of 96% demonstrates superior performance in correctly classifying instances across both classes.

Discussion & Future Directions:
performance comparison of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models shows strong performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
Logistic Regression slightly outperforms Naive Bayes, achieving higher precision, recall, and F1-score.
Naive Bayes is computationally efficient and requires less training data, while Logistic Regression models feature relationships more flexibly. 
Both models offer interpretability, but Logistic Regression offers interpretable coefficients.
Future directions include feature engineering, ensemble methods, deep learning approaches, hyperparameter tuning, domain-specific adaptation, and evaluation on diverse datasets to improve performance and generalization capabilities.
